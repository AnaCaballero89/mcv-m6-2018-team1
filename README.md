# M6 Project - Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring

The goal of the project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequences, which can be used for example for surveillance applications. The project is divided into 5 weeks and will include tasks such as background and foreground estimation, video stabilization and region tracking.

## Week 1

### Task 1: Segmentation metrics. Understand precision & recall

- [X] Given the sequences TEST A and TEST B using different background substraction methods, implement and compute the evaluation measures 
    - True Positive
    - True Negative
    - False Positive
    - False Negative
    - Precision
    - Recall
    - F1 Score
    
- [ ] Explain the numerical results obtained and provide an interpretation of the different values

### Task 2: Segmentation metrics. Temporal analysis
- [X] Temporal analysis of the results. Create 2 graphs:

    - True Positive & Total Foreground pixels vs frame 
    - F1 Score vs frame

### Task 3: Optical flow evaluation metrics


### Task 4: De-synchornized results


### Task 5: Visual representation optical flow



What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

**Badges will go here**

- build status
- issues (waffle.io maybe)
- devDependencies
- npm package
- coverage
- slack
- downloads
- gitter chat
- license
- etc.
