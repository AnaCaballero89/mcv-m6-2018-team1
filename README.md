## Week 1



### Task 1: Segmentation metrics. Understand precision & recall
- [ ] Given the sequences TEST A and TEST B using different background substraction methods, implement and compute the evaluation measures.



### Task 2: Segmentation metrics. Temporal analysis


### Task 3: Optical flow evaluation metrics


### Task 4: De-synchornized results


### Task 5: Visual representation optical flow



What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

**Badges will go here**

- build status
- issues (waffle.io maybe)
- devDependencies
- npm package
- coverage
- slack
- downloads
- gitter chat
- license
